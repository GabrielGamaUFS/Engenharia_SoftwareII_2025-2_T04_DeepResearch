--- RELATÓRIO ARQUITETURAL DO LLM ---

Based on the provided metadata and code snippets, here is my analysis of the architecture:

1. Padrão de Ponto de Entrada:
The main entry point of the system appears to be the `WebAgent/WebSailor/main.py` file, which is the starting point for the system. The `requirements.txt` file also lists several packages that are used in the system, including `fastapi`, `huggingface`, and `torch`.
2. Padrão de Estrutura de Código:
The code structure appears to be organized into several directories, including `WebAgent/WebSailor/`, `WebAgent/WebSailor-V2/`, `WebAgent/WebDancer/`, `WebAgent/WebSailor/`, `WebAgent/WebResearcher/`, `WebAgent/WebWalker/`, `WebAgent/WebLeaper/`, `WebAgent/WebShaper/`, `WebAgent/WebWatcher/`, `WebAgent/WebResummer/`, and `WebAgent/WebWeaver/`. Each of these directories contains a set of files that are related to the specific functionality of the system.
3. Padrão de Implantação:
The system appears to be deployed on a cloud platform, as indicated by the `aliyun-python-sdk-core` package in the `requirements.txt` file. The system also appears to be using a containerization technology, as indicated by the `docker` package in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Resumo da Arquitetura:
The system appears to be a web-based system that uses a combination of natural language processing and deep learning techniques to perform various tasks, including information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization. The system uses a combination of Python and CUDA technology to perform these tasks. The system also appears to be using a cloud platform for deployment and containerization technology for deployment.
